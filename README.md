This project is an implementation of the producer-consumer design pattern in the context of image processing in Java. The producer has the role of reading an image from a file, splitting this image into four pieces and placing them in a buffer. The consumer takes these chunks from the buffer, concatenates them, and performs final image processing. Synchronization between producer and consumer is handled by the Buffer class.

In the Consumer class, the consumer threads are implemented. These take the image data from the buffer, concatenate it and perform the final processing. It also implements the ImageProcessor interface both for flexibility in image processing and to demonstrate the abstract class concept. The overwritten method is the one that performs the application of the "smooth" effect on the image, by using the Gaussian convolution mask. This is applied to each pixel and each of its color channels. At the end of image processing, its processing time is determined.
